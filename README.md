# Live-Streamer-Discord-Assistant

(Unreleased) A little bot to help streamers do various little maintenance tasks in their Discord. From integrating with Google calendars to provide updates on planned games, special event/react channels, etc...

The bot is currently named "Gorlock the Destroyer" and is in development. It is currently just designed to work on one server at a time and is not yet ready to be deployed to others in multiple servers.
